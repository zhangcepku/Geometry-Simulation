Detector Geometry:

Geometry for scintillators only
  - contains aluminum casing
  - detector material inside casing
  - PMTs also included

Two detectors spaced 5m apart
4 layers of tiles in each detector, offest for any overlaps between tiles

Finalalized mounting desgin must still be implemented
